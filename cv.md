I'm an intermediate C++ developer with some C experience, now learning Rust. I'm also comfortable with Lua and CMake, and know my way around Git and Linux.

I think documentation is half of code quality so I've made a point in becoming a skilled technical writer too.

# Personal Projects, Past and Present

## VZScript

My focus right now is [VZScript](https://github.com/jerome-trc/viletech/blob/master/spec/vzs-spec.md), a bespoke scripting language to be embedded in games and other programs that may benefit.

Eventual goals are a [Cranelift](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift)-based backend complete with an interpreter and JIT, along with a memory model based on [Mike Pall's garbage collector design for LuaJIT 3.0](https://web.archive.org/web/20220826233802/http://wiki.luajit.org/New-Garbage-Collector).

While its primary goal is to iterate on GZDoom's [ZScript](https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZScript) for use in development of Doom source ports, I am building it such that it can be seamlessly re-used in any other application that benefits from scripting.

See https://github.com/jerome-trc/viletech/blob/master/docs/vzs-rationale.md for the reasoning as to the decision to do this.

## LOUD Project

I'm a passive maintainer on the [LOUD Project](https://github.com/LOUD-Project/Git-LOUD), a modification to the 2007 RTS Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. Between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 I made a number of user interface and user experience improvements along with delivering bug fixes. I continue to provide counsel and occasional patches whenever necessary.

## Machinate

In early 2022 I wanted to learn more Vulkan and C++, so I developed a Forward Plus renderer based on [this work](https://github.com/WindyDarian/Vulkan-Forward-Plus-Renderer), with the possibility of using it to build a game. It never got that far but it remains functional, although [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) (or a similar program) is required to visualise the output.

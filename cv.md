I'm an intermediate C++ developer with some C experience, now learning Rust. I'm also comfortable with Lua and CMake, and know my way around Git and Linux.

I think documentation is half of code quality so I've made a point in becoming a skilled technical writer too.

# Personal Projects, Past and Present

## LOUD Project

I'm a passive maintainer on the [LOUD Project](https://github.com/LOUD-Project/Git-LOUD), a modification to the 2007 RTS Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. Between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 I made a number of user interface and user experience improvements along with delivering bug fixes. I continue to provide counsel and occasional patches whenever necessary.

## Machinate

In early 2022 I wanted to learn more Vulkan and C++, so I developed a Forward Plus renderer based on [this work](https://github.com/WindyDarian/Vulkan-Forward-Plus-Renderer), with the possibility of using it to build a game. It never got that far but it remains functional, although [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) (or a similar program) is required to visualise the output.

# Education
